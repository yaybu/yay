Yay is a non-strict lazily evaluated configuration language. It combines
YAML-like data declarations with lazy python expressions. We really hope you
like this, please let us know if it's useful.

Yay is very new software, and although we have tested it a lot it is
certainly full of bugs. Please subscribe to the yaybu-dev mailing list, which
you can find on http://lists.yaybu.com.

All documentation can be found at http://yay.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ which
includes a tour of the language and an explanation of the grammar.

If you are interested in this project, you should probably check out Yaybu,
which uses Yay to drive a complete system deployment and management system.
You can find Yaybu at http://yaybu.com.
