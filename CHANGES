Changelog for yay
=================

0.0.43 (2012-02-12)
-------------------

- Fix handling of paths on searchpath without a scheme.


0.0.42 (2012-01-01)
-------------------

- Change how Django boxing works so that a .bind isn't required for the
  boxing mechanism to work. This allows raw Django mdoels to be pushed
  into Yay using the ``.add`` API from 0.0.41.


0.0.41 (2011-12-21)
-------------------

- You can inject Python objects into the Yay Config object, as long as Yay
  knows how to box them. If you had a Yay file like this::

      hello: abc
      result: ${hello}

  And the following python code::

      from yay.config import Config
      c = Config()
      c.load_uri(example_file)
      c.add(dict(hello="xyx"))

  Then the following assertion is true::

      c.get() == dict(hello="xyz", result="xyz")


0.0.40 (2011-12-13)
-------------------

- Fixes calling macros defined in other files.


0.0.39 (2011-11-30)
-------------------

- Fix string builder so that configs containing secrets can be pickled.


0.0.38 (2011-11-22)
-------------------

- This is a bugfix release to improve existing features, especially boxing of
  foreign data.

- Move more code away from direct use of ``Boxed`` to ``BoxingFactory.box``

- Wrap any dictionary objects in a Mapping object so they can be merged with
  other mappings that come from within Yay. 


0.0.37 (2011-11-20)
-------------------

- Brown paper bag release to remove stray print.


0.0.36 (2011-11-20)
-------------------

- There is now a ``home://`` URL handler. For my laptop this means::

      import yay
      yay.load_uri("home://foo/bar.yay")

  Is equivalent to::

      import yay
      yay.load_uri("/home/john/foo/bar.yay")

- Improve searchpath handling to better cope with URIs.

- Add support for ``else`` keyword in expressions as per YEP2::

      foo:
          bar: ${foo.baz else 52}

  This is useful for providing sensible defaults in your recipes.

- The loop block is now autoflattening. This means that constructs that yield
  lists of lists will be turned into 1-dimensional lists by ``.foreach``. For
  example::

      somelist:
        - - - a
            - b
          - c
        - d

      someotherlist.foreach var in somelist: ${var}

  The list ``someotherlist`` would now contain::

      somelist:
       - a
       - b
       - c
       - d

  The previous behaviour can be obtained with the ``chain`` modifier::

      somelist.foreach var in somelist chain: ${var}

- Add a simple macro language. This is highly EXPERIMENTAL and subject to
  frequent syntax tweaks. You can define a reusable block of configuration
  using the .define statement. An example of this in Yaybu to create a reusable
  virtualenv step::

    .define Virtualenv:
      - Directory:
          name: ${venv.location}
          owner: ${venv.owner}
      - Execute:
          name: create-virtualenv-${venv.location}
          command: virtualenv --no-site-packages ${venv.location}
          creates: ${venv.location}/bin/pip
      - Execute:
          name: install-requirements-${venv.location}
          command: ${venv.location}/bin/pip install -r ${venv.requirements}

  The macro is callable inline as part of an expression. For example::

    resources.append:
      .foreach venv in virtualenvs: ${Virtualenv!}

  Equally you can do this::

    .define Virtualenv:
      - Directory:
          name: ${location}
          owner: ${owner}
    # SNIP

    resources.append:
        Virtualenv!:
          location: /tmp/example
          owner: dave
          requirements: /tmp/requirements.txt


0.0.35 (2011-11-12)
-------------------

- This release refactors ProtectedString to make it more useful outside Yay.
  Instead of importing ``yay.protectedstring.ProtectedString`` you should
  import ``yay.String``

- You can now pass strings to the constructor and they will automatically be
  wrapped. Previously you had to pass StringPart's to the constructor. That is
  now an internal implementation detail.

- There is now an extend() function. This accepts lists that contains a mixture
  of raw strings and other ``String`` objects::

      s = String("echo")
      y = String("supersekritpassword", secret=True)
      s.extend(["a", "b", y, "d"])

- There is now an as_list() function. This returns all the parts you have added
  to a string. This is useful if you are building a command line to pass to
  subprocess::

      s.String(["someprogram", "--pasword"])
      s.add_secret("password")

      # Log the obfuscated version but execute with the real password
      log.info(s.protected)
      p = subprocess.Popen(s.as_list(secret=False), cwd="/")

- There is now a ``secret`` call in Yay for exercising secret Yay without
  needing to use GPG. This is mainly for test purposes, but might be useful if
  you have strings which arent closely guarded secrets yet you dont want them
  show in logs. To use it you do something like this::

      resources.append:
        - Checkout:
            name: /checkouts/mycode
            repository: http://github.com/whatever
            scm_password.secret: mypassword

  This example is from Yaybu and would stop Yaybu from logging your SVN
  password.

0.0.29 (2011-11-10)
